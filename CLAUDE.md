# Docker Compose Environment

This is a Docker Compose environment for running a website.

## Project Structure
- Simple Docker Compose setup
- Currently minimal with just a README
- Docker compose will be broken down into a number of files
 - data-stores.yml - for things like mongo, kafka, elastic search
 - observability.yml - for things like grafana cloud
 - services.yml - for any of the services that I have built

## Development Commands
- `docker-compose up` - Start the environment
- `docker-compose down` - Stop the environment



## Notes
- This appears to be a new project with minimal configuration
- No specific testing or linting commands identified yet
